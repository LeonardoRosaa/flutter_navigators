Basically, navigator works as `stack`. When `push` is called, the widget is placed on top of `stack`. Like this:

## Navigator 2.0

Flutter 1.22 introduced navigator 2.0, a new declarative API that allows you to take full control of your navigation stack. Advantages:

- Manage your pages. More power, more control;
- Can use both imperative and declarative styles in the same app;
- Parse routes and handles web URLs and deep linking.

It include new keys:

- [**Page**](https://master-api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Page-class.html): an immutable class that describes the configuration for a route;
- [**Router**](https://master-api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Router-class.html): configures the list of pages the Navigator displays;
- **[RouteInformationParser](https://master-api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Router/routeInformationParser.html)**: the route information parser for the router;
- [**RouterDelegate**](https://master-api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/RouterDelegate-class.html): This delegate is the core piece of the Router to build and configure a navigating widget;
- **[BackButtonDispatcher](https://master-api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/BackButtonDispatcher-class.html)**: reports back button presses to the Router.
